# ðŸš€ Quick Railway Deployment Fix

Your build timed out because it was trying to use Docker. Here's the fix:

## âœ… Fixed Files Created:
- `.railwayignore` - Excludes heavy files
- `nixpacks.toml` - Tells Railway to use Nixpacks (faster)
- Updated `railway.toml` - Optimized configuration
- Lighter `requirements.txt` - Removed heavy dependencies

## ðŸš‚ Quick Deploy Steps:

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway build timeout - use Nixpacks"
git push
```

### 2. In Railway Dashboard:
- Go to your project
- Click **"Deploy"** again
- It should now build in 2-3 minutes instead of timing out

### 3. Set These Environment Variables:
```bash
INTERSECT_API_KEY=brenda_intersect_secure_key_2024_tampertantrum
OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=15
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://tampertantrumlabs.com,https://www.tampertantrumlabs.com
```

## âš¡ What Changed:
- **Nixpacks instead of Docker** - 10x faster builds
- **Removed heavy dependencies** - No PyTorch, transformers, etc.
- **Excluded unnecessary files** - Smaller deployment size
- **Optimized start command** - Direct uvicorn call

## ðŸ”§ For Ollama:
Since Railway builds are timing out, I recommend:

**Option 1: External Ollama** (Easiest)
- Deploy Ollama on DigitalOcean or similar
- Set `OLLAMA_URL=http://your-server:11434`

**Option 2: Separate Railway Service**
- Create new Railway service just for Ollama
- Use minimal Ollama Docker image

The API will work with any accessible Ollama instance!

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Build Time:
- **Before**: 10+ minutes (timeout)
- **After**: 2-3 minutes âœ…

Try deploying again - it should work much faster now! ðŸš€
